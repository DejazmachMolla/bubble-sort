# Bubble Sort

> Bubble sort is an inefficient sorting algorithm that sorts at O(n*n) time complexity. This project is simply a practice for the Ruby Programming Language.

## Built With

- Ruby

# Requirements

- The code needs to have a sorting method that sorts arrays using the Bubble Sort algorithm

## Getting Started

- Clone the project in to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/DejazmachMolla/bubble-sort.git` 
- `cd` into the `bubble-sort` folder
- Open buuble_sort.rb and add the following 4 lines to test the program
- print bubble_sort([6, 5, 7, 3, 9, 0])
- puts
- print bubble_sort_by(["Abebe", "Kebede", "Amy", "Abe"]) { |a, b| a.length <=> b.length }
- puts
- run the command `ruby bubble-sort.rb`
